// better use of fetch and promises - read codecademy, YDKJS, mdn
// better error handling - maybe some try catch statements
// better understanding of cors
// better understanding of fetch headers
// remove duplicate pokemon 
// give every picture owner etc their credit
// add shine animation on hover on cards
// when a new input is put in, cancel all previous requests -  maybe have a global array of all current requests and whenever a new search is done, all the requests are aborted (possibly using an 'abort' method on the fetch api?)
// create the loading animations out of pure css
// create a complex pokemon-related loading animation
// improve responsiveness
// drop-menu with types/pokemon (+ the app also works with typing a pokemons name)
// selecting types by clicking tags
// instead of using cards - display 6 clickable icons, which open modals with the pokemons data (6 is the number of pokemon in a team)
// change opening paragraph

// could utilize .map to make navigating and manipulating the fetch responses better
// could use the fetch apis second parameter to include an object which has something like mode: 'cors' -> which can allow cross orgin blah blah blah instead of the temporary fix i've been using.
// could use Promise.all better
